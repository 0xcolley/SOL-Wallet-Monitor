# SOL-Wallet-Monitor
An application built using Helius.xyz's excellent Solana parsing API which delivers transaction information in a clean &amp; concise manor.

This is my submission for Helius' builder competition, I plan to expand this into an open sourced site that acts as a live trade feed for several Solana influencers
to encourage community trading transparency and build trust.

The config file controls which wallet the program watches and which discord webhook it will send alerts to in the current state.
